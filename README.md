# SondeHub Card
A basic historical radiosonde flight-path display webpage, using data from the Sondehub Database.

## Development & Testing
* Uncomment the `path_fields = ['S1040075'];` line in index.html to override reading Sonde IDs from the URL
* Run up local server: `python -m http.server`
* Point web browser to http://localhost:8000/

## Hosting
TODO (How are we hosting this on AWS currently?)
